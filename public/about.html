    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 25, learning to code in my free time at the moment, while also working as an electrical engineer.</p>

<p>I have a degree in Automotive engineering, specialising in automotive electrics and electronics.</p>

<p>I aspire to be a web developer one day and I hope to be working remotely from a nice warm place in the future.</p>
